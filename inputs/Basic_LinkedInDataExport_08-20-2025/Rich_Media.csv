""In this study, we propose DarkBERT, a Dark Web domain-specific language model based on the RoBERTa architecture. To allow DarkBERT to adapt well to the language used in the Dark Web, we pre-train the model on a large-scale Dark Web corpus collected by crawling the Tor network. We also polish the pretraining corpus through data filtering and deduplication, along with data preprocessing to address the potential ethical concerns in Dark Web texts related to sensitive information. We show that DarkBERT outperforms existing language models with evaluations on Dark Web domain tasks, as well as introduce new datasets that can be used for such tasks. DarkBERT shows promise in its applicability on future research in the Dark Web domain and in the cyber threat industry.""

Cybersecurity use case:
""Dark Web forums are often used for exchanging illicit information, and security experts monitor for?noteworthy?threads to gain up-to-date information for timely mitigation. Since many new forum posts emerge daily, it takes massive human resources to manually review each thread. Therefore, automating the detection of potentially malicious threads can significantly reduce the workload of security experts. Identifying noteworthy threads, however, requires a basic understanding of Dark Web-specific language.""

I?m not excited about the future for my daughters (currently toddlers) in this context. Hopefully our communities and technology providers take the advice in here seriously. I plan to develop a family media usage plan. It?s like a diet but for devices instead of food. 

What social media does to our minds and moods is one thing. Our brains is another:

Brain development is a critical factor to consider when assessing the risk for harm. Adolescents, ages 10 to 19, are undergoing a highly sensitive period of brain development. This is a period when risk-taking behaviors reach their peak, when well-being experiences the greatest fluctuations, and when mental health challenges such as depression typically emerge. Furthermore, in early adolescence, when identities and sense of self-worth are forming, brain development is especially susceptible to social pressures, peer opinions, and peer comparison.

Frequent social media use may be associated with distinct changes in the developing brain in the amygdala (important for emotional learning and behavior) and the prefrontal cortex (important for impulse control, emotional regulation, and moderating social behavior), and could increase sensitivity to social rewards and punishments. As such, adolescents may experience heightened emotional sensitivity to the communicative and interactive nature of social media. 

Adolescent social media use is predictive of a subsequent decrease in life satisfaction for certain developmental stages including for girls 11?13 years old and boys 14?15 years old.

Depression and anxiety is just the tip of the iceberg. Suicide, self-harm, eating disorders, and sexual predators are what lies beneath.

In fact, it increases both productivity and profitability. The more the human work could be automated, the better the business performed. The more often the business talked publicly about the effects of tools like ChatGPT, the better the business performed. 

Have these conversations and start learning how to integrate AI into your business and workflow. I?m here to help. We will look back on this time as revolutionary. 

?Our key finding is that the arrival of ChatGPT had a sizable positive effect on the value of firms whose labor forces are more exposed to Generative AI and related Large Language Models (LLMs). Firms with higher exposure to the release of ChatGPT, as measured by the exposure of their labor force to being made more productive by tools like ChatGPT, outperform firms with lower exposures by over 40 basis points in daily excess returns during the two weeks following its release. Notably, these return differences are not only due to differences in labor force exposures across industries. Returns of firms with high labor force exposures also outperform firms with low exposures by about 40 basis points daily in industry-neutral portfolios.?

Of course, for me, I hope firms redistribute these gains equitably to the workforce instead of just increasing their profit margins. If they don?t, their margins are my opportunity to steal their talent ? and pay people more fairly.
