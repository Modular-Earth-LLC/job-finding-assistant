Human Computer Interaction Course Project: Tempus Fugit,"I took this class my Senior year in College. Human Computer Interaction is one of my favorite research areas and is still central to the work I do today.  Broadly stated, there are four goals for this class: 1) Understand the principles of user-centered design and how to apply them to a software-based project 2) Understand the history of human-computer interaction and how it’s changed over time 3) Explore why “good” interface design is not necessarily “common sense” 4) Utilize skills and knowledge from other disciplines in developing a software-based project  During the semester we primarily focused on one project as described in the syllabus:  You will undertake a group project to: + evaluate some computing-related task/problem  + develop interface design alternatives for the task/problem  + implement a prototype of your design  + evaluate your design  The theme for this semester’s projects is: Connecting to (*) You.  You should think of this domain as exploring how technological innovation can help an individual become the person they want to be. Thus, the * in the domain above can be “a better”, “a wealthier”, a “healthier”, etc. By design, this is a large and rich domain to explore and we will help you investigate ideas for different problems to explore in this solution. The critical aspect of selecting a problem is that it must matter to some “real-life” people. These people can be a small group of individuals, or a large one, or any group in-between, but they will serve as your “clients” whom you must communicate with and learn from.",http://www.behance.net/gallery/Coursework-Human-Computer-Interaction/13666849,Jan 2011,Apr 2011

Charlotte Startup Weekend Six: Team 'FitBloc',"For the Sixth Charlotte Startup Weekend my team came up with the business model and wireframe behind FitBloc. The two original team members were skilled, driven, and full of energy. As the visionary, Ryan Cates pitched the idea. His passion, and the development background behind his partner, sold me immediately.  The first problem we addressed: health information is increasingly difficult for the fitness community to navigate. The second problem: fitness professionals do not have a single tool-set for online marketing and branding. FitBloc is an online platform that brings the right information and resources to the right people when they need it. - https://twitter.com/fitbloc - https://www.facebook.com/fitbloc  More about the event: ""Startup Weekends are weekend-long, hands-on experiences where entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs can find out if startup ideas are viable. On average, half of Startup Weekend’s attendees have technical or design backgrounds, the other half have business backgrounds.  Beginning with open mic pitches on Friday, attendees bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. Over Saturday and Sunday teams focus on customer development, validating their ideas, practicing LEAN Startup Methodologies and building a minimal viable product. On Sunday evening teams demo their prototypes and receive valuable feedback from a panel of experts."" - http://startupweekend.org/",http://bit.ly/1lkVLwd,Jan 2014,Jan 2014

For Principal, the data was piped into an engine that predicted earnings surprise and will eventually influence investment decisions.",,Feb 2018,May 2018
Genomics Data Lake,"A genomics client of ours was operating entirely on-premises. Data was being stored locally on SAN disks and analytics were performed via Jupyter Hub hosted on their over-utilized HPCs. We wrote and deployed a software agent on their HPCs as a file gateway, allowing them to essentially mount a file storage system with low latency access to their newly created S3 buckets. Since the amount of data they had to move at the start was not too large, they requested for us to implement a site-to-site VPN for data transfer to save costs. We used AWS Glue to transform the data into a columnar format, Parquet, as it was optimized for the type of queries they planned to execute. To save both time and money, a transformation must occur when the technician attempts to query the data.  To facilitate this, when the query is ran, a CloudWatch event is fired that causes AWS Glue to transform the VCF files into Parquet and save them into another S3 bucket in their Data Lake.  The AWS Glue Data Catalog was then updated to reflect these changes. Overall, we successfully implemented a production-ready start to their data lake and automated several tasks for their data engineers.",https://www.hyperbloom.ai/,Jun 2021,Nov 2021

My Open Source and Local-First AI Tech Stack,"I am building an AI agent/app to help people develop a career strategy and apply for jobs. I’m obsessed with open source, self-hosted, local first, multi-agent workflows. The tech stack is centered around libraries like Ollama, LangChain, n8n, and Neo4j. I use Rust and TypeScript as my programming languages. I’m focused on getting people off big tech cloud providers for benefits related to cost, privacy, security, intellectual property, control, and simplicity. The only hosting providers I plan on using are highly principled companies like Hugging Face, Mistral.ai, Together.ai, and Storj.io when local computing or storage doesn’t fit the use case. The app doesn’t need an internet connection, so I focus on local desktop apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux. I specialize in local-first app frameworks like Tauri, so I never have to deploy this app to multi-tier cloud environments, which lets me keep it hella simple and private/secure. ",,Jan 2024,
