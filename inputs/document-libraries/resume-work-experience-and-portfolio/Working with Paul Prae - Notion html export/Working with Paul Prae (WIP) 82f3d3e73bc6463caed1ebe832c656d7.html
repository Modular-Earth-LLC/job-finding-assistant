Using this platform as an entrepreneur himself, he advises clients and builds products that empower neuroscience researchers and mental health clinicians with emerging technology to decrease the prevalence of disease and trauma. He <em>envisions</em> a partnership ecosystem of small, privately-owned, self-funded technology consulting companies, open-source software vendors, and decentralized scientific research organizations that share knowledge, talent, sales, tools, and other resources efficiently. His <em>values</em> include being equitable, healthy, empirical, transparent, consensual, inclusive, philanthropic, revolutionary, future-proof, and focused. His <em>personal bio</em> includes being a parent of two, a life partner of one, and a socially progressive lover of people. He copes with the absurdity of existence by playing drums, listening to music, reading, working, and spending time outside with his kids.</div></figure><p id="792d68db-dc79-432b-8c0f-76aad3931ef8" class="">

This involves respecting each other’s boundaries and actively weaving our principles and processes together. I respect the way other people work through an adaptive leadership style while encouraging the use of standard project management methodologies (like software development lifecycles) and operating procedures (like sales outreach processes). This combination of leadership approaches allows us to balance autonomy with predictable routines and creativity with operational efficiency. </li></ol><ol type="1" id="9c23085a-dcb5-468c-a093-98e923dd923b" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><em>What you work on</em>. A person should never be forced to work on a project that doesn’t align to their values.

These can range from family duties, like picking kids up from daycare or a mother needing time to breastfeed, or a person following their dreams to be a professional musician or to start their own business. I support individuals living the life they want to live with the assumption that they will help coordinate and focus our collective efforts.

This allows those around me to be efficient with their time (like by not commuting long distances), to live their values (like by not driving and contributing to emissions), to have a unique lifestyle (like by wanting to work from anywhere around the world), and to go on adventures (like to go on tour as a musician).</li></ol><ol type="1" id="8bee880e-63b2-4db6-ac22-5aa9215451eb" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li><em>How much you get paid</em>.

This is especially true given our not-yet-for-profit, revenue-sharing, low operational margin, decentralized, autonomous, anti-authoritarian, radically transparent contract workers cooperative.

With outside investors, we’d have to work for someone else, would lose creative control, and likely be profit-driven instead of people-focused. People who don’t take risks work for people who do.

I’ve lived in a lot of places and had an extraordinary amount of unusual experiences. I’m rebellious, romantic, and socially progressive. To cope with the existential absurdity of life — aka to have fun — I like to play drums, listen to music, watch standup comedy, and touch the earth. I spend most of my raw hours thinking, reading, working (often creating things or talking to people), and taking care of or playing with my kids. I hope to travel and go to concerts and plays more often now that the girls are older. I love my mom and brother.

Part of the fear comes from the fact that parents look at each other to determine what is normal and therefore safe, and they see few examples of families acting as if a 9-year-old can be trusted to walk to a store without a chaperone. But if many parents started sending their children out to play or run errands, then the norms of what is safe and accepted would change quickly. So would ideas about what constitutes “good parenting.” And if more parents trusted their children with more responsibility––for example, by asking their kids to do more to help out, or to care for others––then the pervasive sense of uselessness now found in surveys of high-school students might begin to dissipate.</p><p id="76f2b4c9-8901-4000-ba50-073ad6bfb4dc" class="">If parents don’t replace screen time with real-world experiences involving friends and independent activity, then banning devices will feel like deprivation, not the opening up of a world of opportunities.</p><p id="1cfcf5e7-4af1-4c0e-a21f-2a2eb21040eb" class="">The main reason why the phone-based childhood is so harmful is <em>because</em> it pushes aside everything else.
