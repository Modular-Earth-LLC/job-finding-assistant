### Personal Brand

{{mission}}:
```
- help entrepreneurs achieve economic freedom through their sheer brilliance, collaboration, and hard-work.
- help working-class entrepreneurs procure capital and generate wealth.
- reduce the risk of starting a business by efficiently sharing knowledge, sales, and operational overhead.
- empower entrepreneurs to establish profitable, socially responsible businesses while maintaining significant ownership and creative control.
- make healthcare more affordable and accessible by disrupting the economic systems that fail to serve the general public. 
- address harmful systemic issues that hinder life science research organizations and healthcare providers from effectively solving pressing human health problems.
- empower neuroscience researchers and mental health clinicians with emerging technology, breakthrough business models, and strategic partnerships. 
- improve quality of life for all humans by reducing the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and generational trauma. 
```

{{vision}}:
```
- Through emerging technology, cooperative economic principles, and collective bargaining power, my partners and I will disrupt systemic wealth inequities and change the fundamental nature of work.
- a national partnership ecosystem of small, privately-owned, self-funded technology consulting companies, open-source software vendors, and decentralized scientific research organizations that share knowledge, talent, sales, tools, and other resources efficiently. 
- a massive collective of businesses that can compete against incumbent large corporations by partnering together to create greater economies of scale than if they were working independently. 
- we all have everything we need, live as long as we want, remain physically strong forever, and feel emotionally safe everywhere.
- a burgeoning society that is fully inclusive of neurodiverse people, with accessible and personalized healthcare and workplaces the norm.
- a world without disease where mental health disorders are viewed as forms of diversity instead of as problems to solve.

```

{{values}}:
```
- *Equitable*: the wealth, business, and power I create is fairly distributed to, and easily accessible by, my community. I use my power to empower others.
- *Healthy*: improving my physical health improves my mental health, which makes everything in my work and life better. My body is the vehicle for my brain and its nervous system. From a healthy body, a healthy and happy mind emerges. On a global scale, I will always optimize for human health outcomes over business outcomes like profit and cost.
- *Empirical*: I expand my knowledge through the scientific method and by trusting research performed by deep subject matter experts. I take care to never distort scientific facts to fit my beliefs and I maintain a coherent understanding of the universe. I am humble, skeptical, and data-driven.
- *Transparent*: my business processes, finances, and tools are open and accessible to the rest of the community. Everyone has the legal rights and creative freedom to innovate on the platforms that I build.
- *Consensual*: I ask for consent in how people work, when people work, how much people work for, and what people work on. When I can’t accommodate an individual, I work with them towards a mutually beneficial solution.
- *Inclusive*: I am proactive in my support of neurodiversity and people’s raison d'être. I build social support systems that provide a safe space for dissenting opinions and creative expression. I am trauma-sensitive, recognizing when people are withdrawn, defensive, or cautious. I encourage those around me to be brave and share their feelings. I am also aware that people may need time to process their emotions on their own terms.
- *Philanthropic*: I practice extreme giving. This includes releasing control of power and letting go of material wealth. By helping those around me be more successful, I become more successful and feel more fulfilled. I recognize the economic value of caring.
- *Revolutionary*: I actively shift paradigms through the creation of new systems and destruction of old systems. These new systems are robust in how they accommodate human needs and behaviors and they catalyze success through positive feedback loops.
- *Future-proof*: I think long-term and optimize for the whole without marginalizing individuals or small groups. I forecast the effects of trends so I can adapt to (and exploit) social, environmental, and technological change. I don’t bother failing fast when I know how to succeed slow.
- *Focused*: I’m unrelentingly focused on what is wildly important and extremely meaningful. I am always willing to pivot as I gain new understanding, but unless I find a significantly better path forward, I will not stop until my mission is accomplished and my vision is realized.
```

{{user's personality}}:
```
