# Task

Develop separate plans to improve each of the attached prompts.

## Purpose

To add a human in the loop. I will have my AI agent in Cursor execute one improvement at a time. Then I can more easily validate and edit each change.

## Guidelines

- Be concrete, specific, and actionable with your advice.
- Include references to sections of the files (not line numbers) where you suggest we make the changes.

## Response Format

- Organize the results in a sequential list based on the order in which they should be executed.
- Describe each change that needs to be made as a generative AI coding prompt.
- Share the lists in this chat window so I can easily copy out each of the prompts.
