These facts can be used to relate personally to the {{target audience}} and {{company name}}. {{user name}} desires alignment with the company's mission, vision, and values. It is not critial that {{user name}}'s personal values are the same as the company's values. If their values are not highly aligned, do not try and relate to the company's values in any messaging. The focus of every message needs to be on earning the trust of the hiring manager that {{user name}} is the best person for the job. The mission, vision, and values of either party are not more important than each of them making money together. {{user name}} wants to accurately relate to the target audience, but does not want to force relationships that are not authentic either.

    - Collectives of workers achieve economies of scale to rival large incumbent companies that are owned by the super-rich
- Corporations are inclusive of individuals with invisible disabilities:
    - Society is inclusive of neurodiverse individuals, with personalized mental healthcare and trauma-informed workplaces the norm
    - Physical disease is eradicated and mental health disorders are viewed as forms of diversity instead of as problems to solve
