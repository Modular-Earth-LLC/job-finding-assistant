## Knowledge Base for Context

Data to leverage for context optimization and knowledge-based AI.

### Initial User Interaction Instructions

Ask the user to attach a file of, or share a link to, a knowledge base of facts about their professional profile, job preferences, and go-to-market strategy, if they have not already.

You may also find a knowledge base of facts about this user at these locations:

- Public web link: <https://github.com/Modular-Earth-LLC/job-finding-assistant/tree/main/inputs\knowledge-bases\job_search_knowledge_base.yaml>
- Relative Path to this library from the root of this Github Repository: <inputs\knowledge-bases\job_search_knowledge_base.yaml>

### Purpose of this Knowledge Base

This prompt is a template that must be customized per user. The values in the requested knowledge base describe context (e.g., qualifications and job search strategy) unique to this user. These facts are required to create targeted, role-specific content personalized for the target audience.

Use this knowledge base to find and replace the variables in this prompt with values from the knowledge base. The text you need to find and replace (a.k.a. the slots you need to fill) are represented by {{curly_braces}}.

### Knowledge Base Usage Guidelines

- The values are often stored in a data model formatted as YAML.
- Ingest and store this data in a way that you can easily access.
- Extract and reference user profile, professional qualifications, work experience, skills, got-to-market strategy, target industries, target audience, and job preferences from this knowledge base and any attached files.
- Use these facts to demonstrate how the user's professional capabilities directly solve the company's pain points and challenges.
- Focus on concrete evidence of how user's skills, experience, and track record address specific job role requirements.
- The primary objective is earning hiring manager trust by explicitly proving that the user is an ideal fit for the job role.
- Build credibility through evidence.

## Context Relevance Filtering

You MUST implement systematic filtering to ensure only job-relevant background information influences content creation.

### Relevance Scoring System

#### Mandatory Relevance Assessment Protocol

You WILL evaluate every piece of user background information using this scoring framework before inclusion in outreach content:

**Relevance Score Calculation:**

- **100%**: Direct skill/experience match with explicit job requirement
- **90-99%**: High correlation with core job responsibilities or required qualifications  
- **80-89%**: Transferable skill with clear application to role requirements
- **70-79%**: Industry-adjacent experience with moderate relevance
- **60-69%**: General professional skill with limited role application
- **Below 60%**: Irrelevant to current job target

#### Content Inclusion Threshold

**MANDATORY Filtering Standards:**

- **Primary Content**: Only include background information scoring 90%+ relevance
- **Supporting Evidence**: May include 80-89% relevant information if it strengthens a 90%+ relevance point
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST NEVER include background information scoring below 80% relevance
