**I help founders and product leaders ship trustworthy AI products fast with LLM engineering, product strategy, and GTM.**  

Outcome over hype: design small bets, ship quickly, prove value, then scale.

## Services

### Fractional Head of AI

Partner with founders/execs to define the AI roadmap, evaluate feasibility, and stand up a safe, scalable foundation:

- Deliverables: AI opportunity map, technical architecture, hiring plan, initial backlog
- Time to value: 2–4 weeks to first validated plan
- Ideal buyer: Seed–Series B founders, product leaders

### LLM App Build Sprints

Design-to-launch sprints for agentic workflows, retrieval-augmented apps, and internal copilots:

- Deliverables: UX flow, prompt/chain design, eval harness, working prototype, rollout plan
- Time to value: 1–3 weeks to a usable prototype
- Ideal buyer: PM/Eng leaders with a concrete use case

### GenAI GTM Enablement

Package the offer, price it, and enable sales with crisp messaging and proof:

- Deliverables: positioning narrative, pricing/packaging, one-pagers, demo script, case outline
- Time to value: 1–2 weeks to outbound-ready assets
- Ideal buyer: Founder-led sales teams, first GTM hires

Proof strategy: prioritized outcomes, working demos, lightweight evals, and references on request.

## Selected Projects (Gallery)

A few representative builds and patterns that reflect how I ship quickly, verify value, and de-risk scale.

| Project | Role | Context | Stack | Impact | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Job-Finding Assistant | Creator | Open-source | Markdown prompts, Notion | Reusable prompt system for job-seekers | <https://github.com/praeducer/job-finding-assistant> |
| AI Product Discovery Sprint | Facilitator | Early-stage startup | OpenAI, Python, Notion | Clear MVP spec, risk map, experiment plan | — |
| Agentic Support Assistant | Lead Engineer | B2B SaaS | Python, FastAPI, RAG | Reduced manual support load; faster resolutions | — |
| LLM Evals & Safety Harness | Architect | Production LLM | pytest-like evals, red-teaming | Measurable regression control pre-release | — |
| Data-to-Insights Pipeline | Builder | Analytics | dbt, Airflow, SQL | Shorter decision cycles; fewer data defects | — |

- Call-outs: I bias toward thin slices that demonstrate value within weeks, then expand with confidence.

## How I Work

1. Discover — Align on the problem, constraints, and “definition of win.” Map risks early.  
2. Plan — Pick a thin slice with high signal. Write the narrative, interface, and evals first.  
3. Build — Ship a working prototype fast; instrument traces and basic guardrails.  
4. Prove — Run evals and small user tests; capture outcomes and decide next bet.  
5. Scale — Harden for production, expand coverage, enable teams, and measure regressions.

Engagements: fractional, fixed-scope sprints, or advisory. Speed-to-value is the goal.

## About

I’m an AI/product engineer who helps teams turn ambiguous AI ideas into working software that customers value. I focus on practical architectures, crisp interfaces, and lightweight evals that keep quality and safety visible.

My approach is simple: reduce uncertainty quickly, prove value with small bets, and scale what works. Clear narratives, reliable delivery, and thoughtful guardrails beat theatrics every time.

If you need to move from AI talk to shipped outcomes—with the right balance of speed and rigor—I can help.
