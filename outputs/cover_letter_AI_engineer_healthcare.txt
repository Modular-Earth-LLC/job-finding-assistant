**Subject:** Application for AI Engineering Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the AI Engineering position at Aledade. With over 13 years of experience as an AI solutions architect and engineering leader in healthcare, life science, and financial services, I am eager to bring my expertise in AI, machine learning, and data management to your mission of transforming healthcare through innovative technology. Aledade’s commitment to leveraging AI and machine learning to improve clinician satisfaction and patient outcomes deeply resonates with my professional passion and expertise.

At Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Booz Allen Hamilton, I have designed and delivered world-class AI-driven applications and platforms, focusing on solving complex challenges in privacy-sensitive industries. My work includes architecting microservices for machine learning, developing demand forecasting models for healthcare services, and building blockchain-based data platforms—all of which align with Aledade’s focus on data-driven, outcome-based care. For example, I led a project that predicted demand for behavioral health crisis services across dozens of facilities in Georgia, directly supporting operational efficiency and patient care quality. This experience, combined with my background in platform architecture and governance, positions me to contribute immediately to your team’s efforts in advancing coordinated care and reducing fragmentation.

What excites me most about Aledade is your recent emphasis on scaling innovative technology solutions, as highlighted by the appointment of Lalith Vadlamannati, Ph.D., as Chief Technology Officer. His vision to enhance clinician satisfaction and patient outcomes through AI and emerging technologies mirrors my own approach to AI engineering. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with a team that values both technological innovation and its real-world impact on healthcare delivery.

In my previous roles, I have successfully bridged the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that AI solutions are not only robust but also accessible and actionable for end-users. My ability to manage cross-functional teams, mitigate risk through data governance, and operationalize data science experiments has consistently delivered measurable results. I am confident that my skills in engineering team management, platform architecture, and data privacy will enable me to make a significant contribution to Aledade’s mission.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm for healthcare innovation can support your team. Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Aledade’s exciting future.

Best regards,
**Paul Prae**
